Smart Stick for the Visually Impaired

This project aims to provide an affordable, user-friendly, and efficient smart stick for blind or visually impaired individuals. By leveraging Arduino technology, the smart stick can detect obstacles, provide audio or haptic feedback, and enhance mobility and independence.

Features

Obstacle Detection: Ultrasonic sensors to detect objects in the user’s path.

Haptic Feedback: Vibrations to alert the user of nearby obstacles.

Audio Alerts: Optional audio output for obstacle proximity.

Lightweight and Portable: Designed for everyday use.

Customizable: Easy to modify for additional functionalities.
